## Readme
This is basicly my take on the automated script for creating Unbound configs from the domains published in the repo @ UKLANS  Github[https://github.com/uklans/cache-domains]
So all the credits for maintaining and publishing go over to them. 
I have published a few txt files here as we found some records that needed blacklisting or didnt exist on the uklans repo...

The end result currently gives you a lc-host- result so that it can work with the Installer from Nexusofdoom [https://github.com/nexusofdoom/lancache-installer]


## Todo
I will probably create a seperate script in this repo that just asks you the ips and then changes them accordingly in the config files from Unbound...
